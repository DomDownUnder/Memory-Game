# Dom's Wordle

## Game rules

•	Before starting to play the game, I should see an empty grid where I can fill letters in to guess the mystery word. The grid should have 6 rows and 
    3 columns in the first round, which gives me a limit of 6 attempts (i.e. one attempt per row) to get the mystery word right.
•	After each guess, the grid should display in different colors, which letters were guessed correctly, and which letters were wrong. If a letter was in the 
    right position, it should appear in a green frame, if a letter is part of the word but in a wrong position, it should appear in a yellow frame, and if a letter is not part of the mystery word it should appear in a red frame.
•	This colors should appear after every guess, so I can continue playing with reaching the goal of the smallest amount of guesses.
•	The amount of different words to be guessed should be very high, so I can keep playing this game over and over again.
•	After finishing the first round of guessing a 3-letter-word, I want the challenge to get harder, so a 4-letter word should appear next.
•	Since the English language has 37,235 words with 10 letters, I’m sure I can guess a lot of those in an advanced level.
•	The handling of the game should be easy and jump automatically to the next line.
•	My scores should be documented, so I can challenge myself for the next round.
•	I would like a nice but not distracting styling of the game itself with a congratulation after every completed level
