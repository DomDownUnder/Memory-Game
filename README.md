# Dom's Memory Card Game

## Game rules

• On the welcome screen you have to press the "Start Game" button to start the game.
• The grid has 4 rows and 6 columns, which means you have to find 12 matches to win the game.
• You click on one of the squares cards which then will turn around and reveal the face of a singer. Now you have to click on another card, which will turn around and reveal either the same or another singer.
• After each guess, the grid will keep the two pictures revealed, if you found a match. If your two chosen cards don't match they will flip back around after a short time.
• There is a match count, which tells you how many matches you found so far.
• If you made 12 matches you won the game.

## User stories

• I want to play a game that helps me to train my concentration and memory. I am into pop culture, so i'm even more excited about the game. • Before starting to play the game, I want to see a nice and theme matched welcome screen. • A colored frame would give me a nice visual overview of how far i am in the level. • There should be different categories in each level to keep the game exciting. • After finishing the first round, I want the challenge to get harder, so more empty squares should appear. • The handling of the game should be easy and jump automatically to the next level. • My scores should be documented, so I can challenge myself for the next round. • I would like a nice, matching but not distracting styling of the game itself with a congratulation after every completed level
